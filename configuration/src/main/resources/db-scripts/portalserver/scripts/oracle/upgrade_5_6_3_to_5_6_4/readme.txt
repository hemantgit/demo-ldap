The database migration from 5.6.3 to 5.6.4 involves running the following steps in the order mentioned:

1. Create a backup of the database.

Run the next step before the new Portal Web Application has been deployed!
2. Run upgrade-5.6.3-to-5.6.4.sql

If any step fails contact Backbase Support.
If you need to rollback the migration install the database backup.
